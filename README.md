7 semester:

In the first part of the course, we were introduced to classical methods of machine learning and practical assignments were completed on topics such as KNN, Linear Models, PCA, SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

In the second part of the course, we were introduced to DL models and practical assignments were completed on topics such as forward NN models with various activation functions and regularization techniques, RNN, LSTM and CNN.

Final grade (practical assignments + exam): excellent (10).
